#### Resolve DID Document Request

##### Trigger events

A verifier needs to verify the authenticity of a signature on a verifiable credential or presentation.

##### Message semantics

A verifier initiates a resolve DID document request using a HTTP GET request to the DID web url. No further parameters are required.
The DID web url is constructed followint the rules as defined in the [DID Web Method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/).

##### Example

Example did:web

```
did:web:example.com:user:alice
```

Which resolves to the DID document at:

```
GET https://example.com/user/alice/did.json
```

#### DID Document Response

##### Trigger events

      }
    }
  ],

}
