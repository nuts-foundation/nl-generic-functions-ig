### Generieke Functie Lokalisatie (Generic Localization Function)

#### Executive Summary

The Generieke Functie Lokalisatie is a national healthcare infrastructure component designed to enable efficient localization of distributed healthcare data while maintaining strict privacy protections. It implements a lightweight National Verwijs Index (NVI - National Reference Index) that allows healthcare providers to discover where relevant patient data exists across the Dutch healthcare ecosystem without exposing sensitive medical information.

#### Background and Context

The Dutch healthcare system operates on a distributed model where patient data is stored across multiple healthcare providers and systems. This creates challenges for:
- Healthcare providers needing to access comprehensive patient information
- Ensuring continuity of care across different organizations
- Maintaining patient privacy while enabling necessary data sharing
- Managing the complexity of distributed data discovery

The Generieke Functie Lokalisatie addresses these challenges by providing a privacy-preserving index service that answers the fundamental question: "Which healthcare organizations have relevant data about this patient?"

#### Core Concepts

##### National Verwijs Index (NVI)
The NVI serves as a lightweight metadata index that:
- **Does not store medical data** - only references to where data exists
- **Uses minimal metadata** - just enough information to enable localization
- **Maintains privacy** - uses pseudonymization and access controls
- **Enables distributed queries** - supports searching across the healthcare ecosystem

##### Triple-Key Structure
Each entry in the NVI consists of three essential components:
1. **Polymorphic Pseudonym**: A transformed version of the citizen's BSN (Burgerservicenummer) that:
   - Is unique per healthcare provider
   - Cannot be correlated between different providers
   - Cannot be reversed to reveal the original BSN
   - Requires central party involvement for generation

2. **Healthcare Provider Code (URA)**: Identifies the organization holding the data
   - Standardized organizational identifiers
   - Enables routing of data requests
   - Supports provider switching without identifier changes

3. **Care Context Details**: Minimal information about the type of care or data
   - Medical specialty or department
   - Type of data (imaging, lab results, clinical notes)
   - Temporal information (care episode periods)

#### Architecture Options

##### Option 1: Centralized Index
A single, centrally managed index service that:
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple architecture
  - Single point of management
  - Consistent data state
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Single point of failure
  - Potential privacy concerns with centralization
  - Scalability limitations
  - Attractive target for attacks

##### Option 2: Distributed Replica Approach (Preferred)
Multiple service providers maintaining synchronized copies of the index:
- **Advantages**:
  - High availability through redundancy
  - Enhanced security through distribution
  - Better scalability
  - Reduced single-point-of-failure risks
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
  - Full data replication between nodes
  - Eventual consistency model
  - Multiple independent service providers

#### Query Capabilities

##### Supported Query Types

###### WAAR-vraag (WHERE Question)
"Which legal entities have data about this patient?"
- Input: Patient identifier (pseudonymized)
- Output: List of healthcare organizations with data
- Use case: Initial discovery of data sources

###### WELKE-vraag (WHICH Question)
"Which specific datasets are available?"
- Input: Patient identifier + context parameters
- Output: Detailed metadata about available datasets
- Use case: Targeted data discovery for specific needs

###### Person-specific WELKE-vraag
"Does this specific provider have data in this context?"
- Input: Patient identifier + provider + context
- Output: Confirmation and metadata
- Use case: Verification before data requests

##### Query Parameters and Filters
- **Temporal filters**: Data from specific time periods
- **Medical context**: Specific specialties or care types
- **Data type filters**: Imaging, lab results, clinical notes
- **Body part specification**: For imaging and procedure data
- **FHIR-compatible queries**: Support for standard healthcare queries

#### Privacy and Security Framework

##### Privacy by Design Principles

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Store only essential metadata
   - No medical content in the index
   - Minimal exposure of patient relationships

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Clear definition of allowed uses
   - Audit trail of all queries
   - Enforcement of medical necessity

3. **Pseudonymization Strategy**
   - Polymorphic pseudonyms prevent correlation
   - Provider-specific identifiers
   - Central involvement for pseudonym generation
   - No possibility of reversal to BSN

##### Authorization Framework

###### Multi-Layered Access Control
The system implements authorization at multiple levels:

1. **Organization Type Authorization**
   - Verify requesting organization's credentials
   - Check organization type permissions
   - Apply sector-specific rules

2. **User Role Authorization**
   - Validate individual user credentials
   - Check role-based permissions
   - Apply professional-specific restrictions

3. **Context-Specific Authorization**
   - Evaluate care relationship
   - Check medical necessity
   - Apply privacy regulations

###### Authorization Matrix
The system uses a complex authorization matrix considering:
- **Requester characteristics**: Organization type, user role, specialty
- **Data source characteristics**: Provider type, data sensitivity
- **Contextual factors**: Active care relationship, emergency status, consent

Example: A physiotherapist at a primary care practice should not automatically access psychiatric institution records, even if both organizations participate in the system.
